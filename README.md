## First Repo

This is my first VCS repo (Joined GitHub) on July 28, 2020 (Tuesday).

I began my software development journey in December 2019, motivated by Sir Zia Khan, whom I truly admire. I also want to thank Sir Zeeshan Hanif, Sir Aamir Pinger, Sir Ghous Ahmed, and Sir Inzamam Malik for their inspiration and teaching.
